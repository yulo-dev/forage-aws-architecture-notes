# Forage AWS Architecture Notes

This repository contains my completed work for the **AWS APAC Solutions Architect Virtual Experience** on Forage (July 2025).  
The program simulates a real-world client scenario where a startup is experiencing performance and scalability issues. My task was to propose a scalable AWS hosting architecture and communicate the solution in plain language.

## What I Learned

This experience helped me connect technical decision-making with customer needs. It also highlighted the importance of designing for growth, minimizing downtime, and clearly explaining infrastructure and billing to non-technical stakeholders.
